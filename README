1. Introduction: Cardiac events cause 23% of sudden-driver deaths (NHTSA 2023)  
2. Related Work: Limitations of current DMS (e.g., Tesla cabin camera misses cardiac signs)  
3. Methodology:  
   - manD 1.0 augmentation with medical labels  
   - Monte Carlo failure mode simulation  
   - CNN + Bayesian network fusion  
4. Validation:  
   - manD dataset (simulator)  
   - On-road tests with paramedics (5 volunteers)  
5. Ethics: Privacy-preserving ECG analytics  
6. Timeline: 3-year plan with industry partnerships (e.g., BMW, EMS)
